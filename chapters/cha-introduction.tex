In programming language design, the main goal of a \emph{static} type system is to prevent certain kind of errors from happening at runtime.
A type system is formulated as a set of constraints that gives any expression or term in a program a well-defined type.
As~\cite{pierceTypesProgrammingLanguages2002} states: ``A type system can be regarded as calculating a kind of \emph{static} approximation to the run-time behaviors of the terms in a program.''
These constraints are enforced by a \emph{type-checker} usually at compile-time.
Any program not satisfying the constraints stated within a type system is simply rejected by the type-checker.

Nevertheless, often the static approximation provided by a type system is not expressive enough.
This happens when the kind of analysis done by the type-checker is not powerful enough to provide a more precise approximation.
This is why programming languages offer several mechanisms to escape the constraints imposed by a type system.
These can take several forms: 
Native functions, Unsafe block, Casting, and Reflection.


What can go wrong with type systems?

\section{Research Question}

We want to understand to what degree \java{}'s type system is useful.
This leads to our research question:

\rquestion{Why Developers Need to Circumvent \java{}'s? Type System}

We propose two studies to help understand these issues

How unsafe is isued
How cast is being used

\section{Proposal Outline}

The rest of this proposal is organized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter \ref{cha:background} presents what are the current issues.
\item Chapter \ref{cha:literature-review} gives an overview of the literature.
\item Chapter \ref{cha:proposal} introduces our plan to answer the aforementioned research questions.
\end{itemize}
