What can go wrong with type systems?

% \cite{milner_theory_1978}

% Escaping the type 
% Overpassing 
% language safety

% Circumvent Java safety features
% type-safety and memory safety

\section{Research Question}

We want to understand to what degree \java{}'s type system is useful.

\rquestion{Why Developers Need to Circumvent \java{}'s?}

We propose two studies to help understand these issues

How unsafe is isued
How cast is being used

% Discovering Unexpected Language Features Usages at Large-Scale by Empirical-based Patterns
% Empirical Usage Patterns Discovery
