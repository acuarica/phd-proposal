https://acuarica.gitlab.io/phd-proposal/phd-proposal.pdf

## Thesis TODOs

* TODO: Add discussion from https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DynamicTyping.html
* TODO: Discuss "Static Typing of Complex Presence Constraints in Interfaces" \cite{oostvogelsStaticTypingComplex2018a}
* TODO: Source of information for cast success: Config files, libraries, more complex analysis
* TODO: What does the compiler need to know to assert that a cast won't fail at runtime?
* TODO: Include type system soundness discussion for thesis
* TODO: Find examples where \code{instanceof} is right and wrong
* TODO: Quantify patterns, Qualitative data
* TODO: Reflection as a way to /escape/ the type system, then talk about casting as a subset of reflection.
* TODO: Expand comment on usages of C \code{goto}s in GitHub (similar to our cast study)
* TODO: What conclusions did they draw on JNI usage?
* TODO: Expand discussion on static vs. dynamic analyses for these kinds of studies
* TODO: How many JEPs have been adopted since 2015?
