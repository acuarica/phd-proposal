It is important to note that our work on the \emph{unsafe} \api{} in \java{} has a moderate impact in the research literature.
Several authors~
\cite{staicu_understanding_2017,jiang_unsupervised_2017,zhang_accepting_2016,saied_cooperative_2016,hora_when_2016,li_accessing_2016,holzinger_-depth_2016} had used our article as evidence of the unsafety in \java{}.
And~\cite{bruno_ng2c:_2017} refer to off-heap memory allocation inside the \jvm{}.
