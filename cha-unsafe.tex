\chapter{The \java{} Unsafe \api{} in the Wild}
\label{cha:unsafe}

We already have published our work on how developers use the \code{sun.misc.Unsafe} API.

We have found 14 usage patterns 

We have analyzed $74 GB$ of compiled \lang{Java} code,
spread over $86,479$ \lang{Java} archives, to determine how \lang{Java}'s unsafe capabilities are used in real-world libraries and applications.
We found that $25\%$ of \lang{Java} bytecode archives depend on unsafe third-party \java{} code, and thus \java{}'s safety guarantees cannot be trusted.
We identify $14$ different usage patterns of \java{}'s unsafe capabilities, and we provide supporting evidence for why real-world code needs these capabilities.
Our long-term goal is to provide a foundation for the design of new language features to regain safety in \lang{Java}.
