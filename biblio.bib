abstract = {Java bytecode instrumentation is a widely used technique, especially for profiling purposes. In order to ensure the instrumentation of all classes in the system, including dynamically generated or downloaded code, instrumentation has to be performed at runtime. The standard JDK offers some mechanisms for dynamic instrumentation, which however either require the use of native code or impose severe restrictions on the instrumentation of certain core classes of the JDK. These limitations prevent several instrumentation techniques that are important for efficient, calling context-sensitive profiling. In this paper we present a generic bytecode instrumentation framework that goes beyond these restrictions and enables the customized, dynamic instrumentation of all classes in pure Java. Our framework addresses important issues, such as bootstrapping an instrumented JDK, as well as avoiding measurement perturbations due to dynamic instrumentation or execution of instrumentation code. We validated and evaluated our framework using an instrumentation for exact profiling which generates complete calling context trees of various platform-independent dynamic metrics.},

abstract = {<p>Message-based communication offers the potential benefits of providing stronger specification and cleaner separation between components. Compared with shared-memory interactions, message passing has the potential disadvantages of more expensive data exchange (no direct sharing) and more complicated programming. In this paper we report on the language, verification, and run-time system features that make messages practical as the sole means of communication between processes in the Singularity operating system. We show that using advanced programming language and verification techniques, it is possible to provide and enforce strong system-wide invariants that enable efficient communication and low-overhead software- based process isolation. Furthermore, specifications on communication channels help in detecting programmer mistakes early---namely at compile-time---thereby reducing the difficulty of the message-based programming model. The paper describes our communication invariants, the language and verification features that support them, as well as implementation details of the infrastructure. A number of benchmarks show the competitiveness of this approach.</p>},

abstract = {We describe an empirical study to understand how different language features in JavaScript are used by developers, with the goal of using this information to assist future extensions of JavaScript. We inspected more than one million unique scripts (over 80 MLOC) from various sources: JavaScript programs in the wild collected by a spider, (supposedly) better JavaScript programs collected from the top 100 URLs from the Alexa list, JavaScript programs with new language features used in Firefox Add-ons, widely used JavaScript libraries, and Node.js applications. Our corpus is larger and more diversified than those in prior studies. We also performed two explanatory studies to understand the reasons behind some of the language feature choices. One study was conducted on 107 JavaScript developers; the other was conducted on 45 developers of Node.js applications. Our study shows that there is a widespread confusion about newly introduced JavaScript features, a continuing misuse of existing problematic features, and a surprising lack of adoption of object-oriented features. It also hints at why developers choose to use language features this way. This information is valuable to the language designers and the stakeholders, e.g., IDE and tool builders, all of whom are responsible for growing a language.},

While social media is a valuable tool for outreach and the sharing of ideas, there is a danger that this form of communication is gaining too high a value and that we are losing sight of key metrics of scientific value, such as citation indices. To help quantify this, I propose the 'Kardashian Index', a measure of discrepancy between a scientist's social media profile and publication record based on the direct comparison of numbers of citations and Twitter followers.},
