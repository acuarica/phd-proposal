Understanding how language features and \api{}s are being used is a broad topic.
There is plenty of research in computer science literature about empirical studies of programs;
which involves several directions directly or indirecly related.
 
Along the last decades, researchers always has been interested in understading what kind of programs programmers write.
The motivation behind these studies is quite broad and --- together with the evolution of computer science itself --- has shifted to the needs of researchers.

Already \cite{Knuth:1971jv} started to study \fortran{} programs.
By knowing what kind of programs arise in practice, a compiler optimizer can focus in those cases, and therefore being more effective.
Alternatively, to measure the advantages between compilation and interpretation in \basic{}, ~\cite{Hammond:1977dq} has to study a representative dataset of programs.

\section{Empirical Studies on Casting}

The closest work to our casting study is by~\cite{Winther:2011:GTP:2076674.2076680}.
Study of type casts in several project.
Quite similar to what we want to do.
Focus on Guarded Type casts.


\section{Impact of using Static Type systems}

Several authors~\cite{Stuchlik:2011:SVD:2047849.2047861,Mayer:2012:ESI:2384616.2384666,7911881} measure whether using a static-type system improves programmers productivity.
They compare how a static and a dynamic type system impact on productivity.
The common setting for these studies is to have a set of programming problems.
Then, let a group of developers solve them in both a static and dynamic languages.

For these kind of studies to reflect reality, the problems to be solved need to
be representative of the real-world code.
Having artificial problems may lead to invalid conclusions.

The work by \cite{Wu:2017:TEF:3152284.3133929,Wu:2017:LUF:3152284.3133930} goes towards this direction.
They have examined programs written by students to understand real debugging conditions.
Their focus is on ill-typed programs written in \haskell{}.
Unfortunately, these dataset does not correspond to real-world code.
Our focus is to analyze code by experienced programmers.

Therefore, it is important to study how casts are used in real-world code.
Having a deep understanding of actual usage of casts can led to
Informed decisions when designing these kind of experiments.

\section{Large-scale Codebase Empirical Studies}

In the same direction to our plan, \cite{Callau:2011:DUD:1985441.1985448} perform a study of the dynamic features of \smalltalk{}.
Analogously, \cite{Richards:2011:EML:2032497.2032503} made a similar study, but in this case targeting \javascript{}'s \eval{} function.

Going one step forward, \cite{Ray:2017:LSP:3144574.3126905} 

These results are useful to make informed decisions about which features to consider when designing language extensions or tool support.

\subsection*{Collections and Generics}

The inclusion of generics in \java{} is closely related to collections.

Java Generics Adoption: How New Features are Introduced, Championed, or Ignored~\cite{Parnin:2011:JGA:1985441.1985446}


\subsection*{Exceptions}

\cite{Kery:2016:EPP:2901739.2903497,Asaduzzaman:2016:DUE:2901739.2903500} focus on exceptions.
They made empirical studies on how programmers handle exceptions in \java{} code.
The work done by~\cite{Nakshatri:2016:AEH:2901739.2903499} categorized them in patterns.
Whether~\cite{7180074} used a more dynamic approach by analysing stack traces and code issues in \github{}.

The exceptions mechanism is orthogonal to the features we target in this proposal.
For instance, we have detected a \smu{} pattern to \throw{} undeclared exceptions.
Similarly, closely related to \emph{casting}, \cce{} is thrown when a cast is invalid.
Therefore, we believe that these kind of studies can be complementary for our research. They can help us to understand how programmers handle exceptions in these scenarios.


\section{Pattern Discovery}

\cite{5463349} have extended \asm{}~\cite{Bruneton02asm:a,Kuleshov07} to implement symbolic execution and recognize call sites.
However, this is only a meta-pattern detector, and not a pattern discovery.
For our study on \smu{}, we needed to discover usage patterns.
Given its a singleton class, we have collected call sites,
and proceed with a semi-automatic analysis.
On the other hand, our study related to casts involved a much more complex analysis.
Therefore we have decided to implement it with manual inspection.

\section{Mining Software Repositories}

When talking about mining software repositories, we refer to extracting any kind of information from large-scale codebase repositories.
Usually doing so requires several engineering but challenging tasks.
The most common being downloading, storing, parsing, analyzing and properly extracting different kinds of artifacts.
In this scenario, there are several tools that allows a reseacher or developer to query information about software repositories.

\cite{Dyer-Nguyen-Rajan-Nguyen-13, Dyer-Rajan-Nguyen-13} built \boa{}, both a domain-specific language and a online platform\footnote{\url{http://boa.cs.iastate.edu/}} to query software repositories on two popular hosting services, \github{}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/}} and \sourceforge{}\footnote{\url{https://sourceforge.net/}}.

The same authors of \boa{} made a study on how new features in \java{} were adopted by developers~\cite{Dyer-Rajan-Nguyen-Nguyen-14}.
This study is based \sourceforge{} data.
The current problem with \sourceforge{} is that is outdated.
For our study on \smu{}, we first tried using \boa{} with sourceforge{}.
We found out that only few projects were using \smu{}.
In contrast, our final study using \maven{} found that an order of magnitude more were using \smu{}.

Another dimension to consider when analyzing large codebases, is how relevant the repositories are.
\cite{Lopes:2017:DMC:3152284.3133908} made a study to measure code duplicity in \github{}.
They found out that much of the code there is actually duplicated.
This raises a flag when consider which projects analyze when doing mining software repositories.

Similar to \boa{}, \lgtm{}\footnote{\url{https://lgtm.com/}} is a platform to query software projects properties.
It works by querying repositories from \github{}.
But it does not work at a large-scale, \ie{}, \lgtm{} allows the user to query just a few projects.
Unlike \boa{}, \lgtm{} is based on \ql{}, an object-oriented domain-specific language to query recursive data structures~\cite{avgustinov_et_al:LIPIcs:2016:6096}.

On top of \boa{}, \cite{7962355} built \candoia{}\footnote{\url{http://candoia.github.io/}}, ``A Platform for Building and Sharing Mining Software Repositories Tools as Apps''.
Although it is not a mining software repository \emph{per se}, it eases the creation of mining applications.
