Programming languages offer a wide range of features that aim to improve programmers productivity.
However, to better drive the future evolution of any programming language, we believe it is paramount to have a thorough understanding of how these features are actually being used in real codebases.

Understanding how developers make use of language features can be helpful to a broad audience besides language designers.
It can aid tool builders to make more realistic assumptions;
researchers to improve the state-of-the-art; and
developers to implement more efficient and effective solutions by providing them best practices.

In this proposal, we target four specific \java{} features, namely, \emph{casting}, \emph{reflection}, \emph{exception handling} and the \emph{unsafe} \api{}.
We plan to divise language and \api{} usage patterns at large-scale to properly assess this broad audience.
We hope that having a better understanding on how these features are used, we can make informed decisions for these driving forces.
