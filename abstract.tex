The main goal of a static type system is to prevent certain kind of errors from happening at run-time.
A type system is formulated as a set of constraints that gives any expression or term in a program a well-defined type.
Yet they provide the means to circumvent their constraints through the \emph{unsafe intrinsics} and \emph{casting} mechanisms.

We want to understand to what degree \java{}'s type system is useful.
To that end,
we plan to empirically study how these two mechanisms
--- unsafe intrinsics and casting ---
are used by developers.
Our study focus on how these features are used in \lang{Java},
given its wide usage and relevance for both research and industry.

We have devised (for the \java{}'s Unsafe \api{}) and we plan to devise (for casting) usage patterns.
We believe that having usage patterns can help us to better categorize use cases and thus understanding how those features are used.
These patterns can provide an insight on how the language is being used by developers in real-world applications.


% item useful to make informed decisions for current \& future language designers, not only \java{},

% Programming languages offer a wide range of features that aim to improve programmers productivity.
% However, to better drive the future evolution of any programming language,
% we believe it is AVOID:paramount to have a thorough understanding of how these features are actually being used in real codebases.

% Understanding how developers make use of language features can be helpful to a AVOID:broad audience besides language designers.
% It can aid tool builders to make more realistic assumptions;
% researchers to improve the state-of-the-art;
% and developers to implement more efficient and effective solutions by providing them best practices.

% In this proposal, we target two specific features, namely, casting and the unsafe API.
% We give the rationale behind our decision on why we chose these features.
% We plan to devise language and API usage patterns at large-scale to properly assess this broad audience.
% We hope that having a better understanding on how these features are used, we can make informed decisions for these driving forces.
