Programming languages offer a wide range of features that aim to improve programmers productivity.
However, to better drive the future evolution of any programming language, we believe it is paramount to have a thorough understanding of how these features are actually being used in real codebases.

Understanding how developers make use of language features can be helpful to a broad audience besides language designers.
It can aid tool builders to make more realistic assumptions;
researchers to improve the state-of-the-art;
and developers to implement more efficient and effective solutions by providing them best practices.

In this proposal, we target two specific features, namely, casting and the unsafe API.
Our study focus on how these features are used in \lang{Java}.
We give the rationale behind our decision on why we chose these features.
We plan to devise language and API usage patterns at large-scale to properly assess this broad audience.
We hope that having a better understanding on how these features are used, we can make informed decisions for these driving forces.
