Over the years, \java{} has evolved considerably since its initial inception.
Nowadays it offers a wide range of features that aim to improve programmers productivity.
However, to better assess the future evolution of the \java{} programming language, it is paramount to have a thorough knowledge of how these features are actually being used in real codebases.

Understanding how developers make use of language features can be helpful to a broad range audience besides language designers.
It can aid tool builders to make more realistic assumptions;
researchers to improve the state-of-the-art; and
developers to implement efficient and effective solutions.

In this proposal we target three specific languages features, namely, \emph{unsafe}, \emph{casting} and \emph{reflection}.
We plan to divise language and \api{} usage patterns at large-scale to properly assess this broad audience.
We hope that having a better understanding on how these features are used, we can make informed decisions for these driving forces.
