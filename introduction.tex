\label{ch:introduction}

Programming language design has been always a hot topic in computer science literature.
It has been extensively studied in the past decades.
For instance, there is a trend in incorporating functional programming features into mainstream object-oriented languages, \eg{}, lambdas in \java{} 8\footnote{\url{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html\#jls-15.27}} and \cpp{}11\footnote{\url{http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1968.pdf}}.
But once a language is released, little is known about how its features are actually used by the developer community.
Therefore, it is extremely difficult to assess how features in a language impact programmers productivity.


researchers miss opportunities to improve the state of the art
tool builders use unrealistic assumptions
language designers fail to improve upon their designs
developers are unable to explore efficient and effective use of lambdas.

Understanding how developers make use of language features can be helpful to a broad range audience.
It can aid language designers to improve their languages;
tool builders can make real assumptions;
researchers to better improve the state of the art;
developers can benefit from are unable to explore efficient and effective.

Language designers add features to their languages based
We believe 
three specific features, namely
We have divised and we plan to divise language and \api{} patterns in order to properly assess this driving forces.
To understand patterns

In this proposal, we plan to explore 
Understanding the Use of Language Features in Java
Supporting informed decisions for these driving forces.
Exploring the usability and feasibility of creating new languages based on empirical studies

\section{Proposal Outline}

In our research we investigate the feasibility of Supercompilation for specific domains.
Whether it is worth it

\begin{itemize}

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:supercompilation} gives an introduction to Supercompilation.

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:gui} we present how supercompilation can be understood from a visual perspective.

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:parser-combinators} Parser combinators are high level description on how to parse a given language.
Because it contains a high-level of composability, supercompilation is the ideal mecanisn to exploit its essence.

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:rewrite-rules} shows how the link between Rewrite Rules and Supercompilation.

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:dependent-types} discusses about the link between Dependent types and Supercompilation.

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:phd-timeline} summarizes the activities carried on so far during my Ph.D. studies.

\end{itemize}



Empirical Analysis


In the article, *In Defense of Soundiness: A Manifesto*,
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/2/182650-in-defense-of-soundiness
the authors claim that in order to understand how the limit of analysis tools impact software,
first we need to understand the what kind of code is being written in the real world.
This fact opens the door for empirical studies about language features and their use in
software repositories, e.g., Maven Central.


* Counting Casts related Instructions and Exceptions in Maven Central

The *Bytecode* column refer to either an cast related instruction or exception.
These are the cast related bytecodes:

- checkcast as specified by:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/\url{jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.checkcast}
- instanceof as specified by:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/\url{jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.instanceof}
- ClassCastException as specified by:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ClassCastException.html

The following two columns indicates how many bytecode where found in:
- *local*
My local machine.
This machine contains a *partial* download of a current snapshot of Maven Central.
Re-download all the artifacts is in progress.
- *fermat*
fermat.inf.usi.ch machine.
This machine contains an old snapshot of Maven Central (2015) 
 
| *Bytecode*         | *local ~ 225.221/1.342.637 jars* | *fermat ~ 300.000/622.310 jars* |
|--------------------+----------------------------------+---------------------------------|
| checkcast          |                       75.486.246 |                     142.425.923 |
| instanceof         |                       15.048.033 |                      25.458.974 |
| ClassCastException |                          404.699 |                         542.049 |
